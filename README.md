# Money-for-Nothing

This is a financial tracking tool that lets people with little to no financial experience retrieve stock and company information. Once information is presented, users are given the option of saving a specific company to a watchlist so they can revisit the stockâ€™s performance at a later time. Users can also keep abreast of the top headlines in business news. It is a particularly useful tool for people new to business or the stock market.

Our team focussed on a financial tool because we all had a common understanding of the topic, it seemed like a good way to integrate information and it could be useful to people with little understanding of finance or stocks. Yes, we were inspired by the Dire Straits song and that is the origin of our project title.  

## User Experience
Users will start their experience by entering a company name on the search bar. If no company comes to mind, the news section provides three top headlines from today's New York Times Business section. Since stock information is tied to a company's stock symbol, the original search will return the stock symbol and company name of the top three matches for the name entered. Chosing from the options presented, users will click the appropriate button and information on the company will be shown, including:
* The sector in which the company operates,
* The exchange on which the shares are traded,
* Year over year growth in quarterly earnings,
* Year over year growth in quartery revenue, and
* Share price as of close the previous business day. 
If users are interested in the company, they are able to add that company/stock to the watchlist. Users are also able to remove companies from the watchlist if they are no longer of interest. 

## Technologies Used
The project allowed us to use an API from the New York Times and three separate API's from Alpha Vantage. We also used local storage, Bootstrap, CSS, JavaScript and HTML to complete the project. 

## Lessons Learned 
This was the first time any of us had used GitHub for joint development and the processes involved in pulling, pushing and merging files proved to be challenging at times. But our struggles with GitHub also served as a source of great learning. Our team also benefited from teamwork. We found that our frequent and detailed communication allowed us to support each other and to make sure that everyone had a deep and up-to-date understanding of project process and functioning. Working together also prevented us from wasting time trying to solve a problem that might be outside our personal knowledge. We found our collective experience and problem solving was very efficient at times. In hindsight, we felt that we could have made better use of the KanBan process. However, we also acknowldged that without a good understanding of relative strengths at the the start of the project, it was difficult to delegate tasks. As the project progressed, we started to use KanBan a little more. 

## Future Features
In the future, we would consider adding the following features to the finance tracker: 
* An ability to graph share price and earnings over time,
* Share price included on the Watchlist button,
* Company-specific headlines in the news section,
* A portfolio management function using 'pretend' funds,
* More precise searches and better use of API's.
